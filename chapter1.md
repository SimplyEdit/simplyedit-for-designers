#First steps

The first thing you need is a website. Just the HTML will do. But you will have to host it on a webserver somewhere. If you try to use SimplyEdit on a HTML file somewhere on your disk directly, none of the javascript code will run. Since SimplyEdit is all about javascript, that won't work.

You can use any kind of webserver. You can even use github to host your website. Github is a website used mostly by programmers to store and share their sourcecode. But you can also use to create and host a website. There's an entire chapter about Github later on. 

If you have no webserver or host yet, you could take a look at the list at http://b2evolution.net/web-hosting/budget-web-hosting-low-cost-lamp.php for some cheap options. These sites all make it very easy to get started. 

To make the rest of the examples in this book, just make sure that you do select support for  PHP 5.4 or higher. There is no requirement to use PHP, but it is one of the simplest ways to get everything to work. If you want to know about alternatives to PHP, take a look at the SimplyEdit for Developers book.
