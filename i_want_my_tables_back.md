# I want my tables back

SimplyEdit does not allow you to insert tables. That is not a bug, its a feature!

Tables and responsive websites don't mix well. There are some solutions out there, but they all are less than stellar.

Tables and WYSIWYG editors don't mix well. Again, some editors have better support than others. Most just frustrate their users.

Tables and accessibility don't mix well. Actually, they can. Its just that nobody really bothers to do it.

So we stopped trying to shoehorn table support into SimplyEdit and make it, well... not simple anymore. Instead we've turned to lists again.
