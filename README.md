SimplyEdit
==========

SimplyEdit is a revolutionary new way of working with your website. It is not just an HTML editor. It is almost a complete CMS (Content Management System) that runs in your browser.

But you don't need any programming skills to work with it and design good looking and easy to edit websites. All you need to know is HTML and CSS. If you do know a bit of javascript, you can use it to extend the editor and your website even more. Luckily there are already a lot of plugins you can use without having to program anything yourself.

This book will help you get started quickly. It's not a large book, because SimplyEdit is, well... simple.
